      <h2 class="glow">1. Cut</h2>
      <p>
        Diamond cut refers to how well a diamond's facets interact with light, determining its brilliance and sparkle. A well-cut diamond reflects light from one facet to another and back to the observer's eye, creating that mesmerizing sparkle known as "fire." The cut grading scale ranges from Excellent to Poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds with an Excellent cut have precise proportions and symmetry, optimizing light performance and maximizing their brilliance. These diamonds are known for their exceptional fire and scintillation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good and Very Good cut diamonds also offer excellent brilliance and sparkle, but they may be more affordable than the top-tier Excellent cut diamonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds with a Fair or Poor cut may lack symmetry and proper proportions, leading to reduced light reflection and diminished sparkle. These diamonds may appear dull and lifeless.

      <h2 class="glow">2. Color</h2>
      <p>
        Diamond color refers to the absence of color in a diamond. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades diamond color on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown). Colorless diamonds (D-F) are rare and highly valuable, as they allow the most light to pass through, resulting in exceptional brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Near-colorless diamonds (G-J) still appear white to the naked eye and offer excellent value for those seeking high-quality diamonds without the premium of colorless stones. As you move down the scale, the diamond may exhibit noticeable color tint, affecting its overall beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds with a color grade beyond Z are known as "fancy colored diamonds," and they possess vibrant colors like blue, pink, yellow, and green. These rare diamonds are prized for their uniqueness.

      <h2 class="glow">3. Clarity</h2>
      <p>
        Diamond clarity assesses the presence of internal and external characteristics called inclusions and blemishes. Clarity is graded on a scale from Flawless (no inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification) to Included (inclusions visible to the naked eye). A higher clarity grade signifies a more visually clear and valuable diamond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds with slightly included (SI) or very slightly included (VS) grades may offer an excellent balance of value and visual clarity. The choice of clarity depends on personal preferences and budget considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clarity of a diamond can affect its beauty, but small inclusions that are not visible to the naked eye often do not impact its brilliance.

      <h2 class="glow">4. Carat Weight</h2>
      <p>
        Carat weight is a measure of a diamond's size, with one carat equal to 200 milligrams. Larger diamonds are rarer, making them more valuable per carat. However, carat weight alone does not determine a diamond's quality; it is crucial to consider all four Cs together to assess a diamond's true beauty and value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smaller diamonds with excellent cut, color, and clarity can be equally stunning and sought-after. Carat weight is a personal preference and depends on individual style and budget considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The carat weight does not directly correspond to the physical size of the diamond, as the cut can affect how large or small a diamond appears. A well-cut diamond can make a smaller carat weight appear more substantial due to its brilliance and fire.
