      <h2 class="glow">Cut</h2>
      <p>
        The diamond cut refers to how well the diamond's facets interact with light, affecting its brilliance, sparkle, and overall visual appeal. A well-cut diamond reflects light from one facet to another and back to the observer's eye, resulting in the mesmerizing display of fire and scintillation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cut is considered the most crucial of the 4 Cs, as it directly impacts the diamond's beauty. A poorly cut diamond may appear lifeless and lackluster, even if it possesses excellent color and clarity grades. On the other hand, a well-cut diamond can make a stone of lower color and clarity appear more beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamond cut grades typically range from Excellent to Poor. The top-tier Excellent cut diamonds exhibit exceptional brilliance and are highly sought after for their captivating sparkle. Good and Very Good cut diamonds offer a balance of beauty and value, while Fair and Poor cut diamonds may lack symmetry and brilliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing a diamond cut, consider your personal style and budget. Round brilliant diamonds are the most popular and offer remarkable fire and brilliance. Fancy shaped diamonds, such as princess, emerald, and oval cuts, showcase a unique and elegant appearance.
      </p>

    <section class="education-section" id="color">
      <h2 class="glow">Color</h2>
      <p>
        The diamond color grade refers to the presence or absence of color in a diamond. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades diamond color on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown).
      </p>
      <p>
        Colorless diamonds (D-F) are rare and highly prized for their exceptional brilliance. These diamonds allow the most light to pass through, resulting in a dazzling display of white light and vibrant colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Near-colorless diamonds (G-J) still appear white to the naked eye and offer excellent value for those seeking high-quality diamonds without the premium of colorless stones. As you move down the scale, the diamond may exhibit more noticeable color tint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the Z grade, diamonds are known as "fancy colored diamonds," and they possess vibrant colors like blue, pink, yellow, and green. Fancy colored diamonds are rare and prized for their unique and stunning hues.
      </p>
      <p>
        When selecting a diamond color, consider the setting and metal color. Colorless diamonds look beautiful in white gold or platinum settings, while slightly tinted diamonds may complement yellow gold settings.
      </p>

    <section class="education-section" id="clarity">
      <h2 class="glow">Clarity</h2>
      <p>
        Diamond clarity refers to the presence of internal and external characteristics called inclusions and blemishes. Clarity is graded on a scale from Flawless (no inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification) to Included (inclusions visible to the naked eye).
      </p>
      <p>
        A higher clarity grade signifies a more visually clear and valuable diamond. However, many inclusions are not visible to the naked eye and may not impact the diamond's brilliance or beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds with slightly included (SI) or very slightly included (VS) grades often offer an excellent balance of value and visual clarity. The choice of clarity depends on personal preferences and budget considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clarity characteristics include pinpoint inclusions, cloudiness, feathers, and crystals. Some inclusions may be hidden by prongs or set beneath the diamond table, making them less noticeable.
      </p>

    <section class="education-section" id="carat">
      <h2 class="glow">Carat Weight</h2>
      <p>
        Carat weight is a measure of a diamond's size, with one carat equal to 200 milligrams. Larger diamonds are rarer and generally more valuable per carat.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, carat weight alone does not determine a diamond's quality. It is crucial to consider all four Cs together to assess a diamond's true beauty and value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smaller diamonds with excellent cut, color, and clarity can be equally stunning and sought-after. The choice of carat weight depends on individual style and budget considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The carat weight does not directly correspond to the physical size of the diamond, as the cut can affect how large or small a diamond appears. A well-cut diamond can make a smaller carat weight appear more substantial due to its brilliance and fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, consider the diamond's shape and how it impacts its visual size. Certain shapes, such as marquise or oval, have elongated appearances, while others, like round or princess cuts, appear more compact.
